## **Loops**

Checks a condition if true a code block will run. It repeats until the condition return false 



### **Types of loops:** 

**For** | **While**| **Do While** 

--------|----------|------------

To run a code a specific number of times, the condition is normally a counter. | If you don't know how many times you want to run the code, the code will continue to loop as long as the condition is true. | It will run the condition at least once even if the condition is false.
