## **Text** 
Tags or markups are added to provide extra meaning to the text, and allows the browser to show the right structure of a webpage.

**There is two types of markups:** 
1. Structural  markups: used to describe headings and paragraphs.
2. Semantic markups: used to add extra information, they don't affect the structure of a webpage. 

**Some of the most used tags meaning:**

## **Introducing CSS** 
Css allows you to creat rules that control the way each individual box is presented. 

**There are two main rules when writing a CSS code: 
1. A selector 
2. A declaration

### **CSS selector examples:**

# **Chapter 2 from JS book** 
## **Basic instructions** 

Statement: is a step/ instruction in a script which the computer follows one by one. statements end with semicolon. 

**NOTE**
Comments are added to make the code easier to read and understand. 

### **Variables** 
**Variables:** are used to store data, bits of information to excuate a job. One can declare a variable by using the var keyword. 

![var example](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7e/Declare-a-Variable-in-Javascript-Step-2.jpg/aid1337336-v4-728px-Declare-a-Variable-in-Javascript-Step-2.jpg)

### **Data types in js:** 
![data type](https://www.wisdomjobs.com/tutorials/data-types.jpg)

**Rules for naming a variable:**
1. It must start with a letter, $, but not a number.
2. It can contain numbers, or _, but not a period. 
3. You can't used keywords or reserved words.
4. variables are case sensitive.
5. Use a name that is related to the information the variable stores.
6. If a variable consists of more than two words, it is best practice to use camelCase. 

### **Arrays**
Stores a list of values related to each other, used when one doesn't know how many items a list will contain. 

**Creating an array:** 
We still use the var keyword, for example 
var type= ["number" , "string" , "boleen"]

**NOTE**
Values in arrays are delt with as if they are in a numbered list. 
It is important to know that numbering starts at zero not one.
Each item is automatically given a number known as index. 

### **Expressions** 
Expressions results in a single value. 

**Expression types:** 
1. assigns a value to a var. 
2. uses two or more values to return a value. 

### **Operators** 
Allows programmers to creat a single value from one or more values. 

**Types of Operators:**

1. Assignment operators:

## **Decisions and loops** 

In order for a script to determine which path to take, one must rely on the following concepts: 
1. **Evaluation:** analyze values to determine wether they match expected results.
2. **Decisions:** based on the result of evaluation, one can decide which path the script should take. 
3. **Loops:** when you want to perform the same set of code more than once. 

**NOTE**
Flowcharts are really helpful to make decision of which path the script should take. 
![chart](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/flowchart.jpg)

### **Steps of making a decision:** 
1. first evaluate the statement then return a value.
2. second a path/condition is applied to each case or situation. 

### **Comparison  operators** 
The result when evaluating a situation by comparsion is boolen ie; true or false. 

**And / Or operators 
![and/or](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xttyf7r3--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_500,q_auto,w_1000/https://cl.ly/7d9cf8370380/Image%25202018-11-15%2520at%25209.59.47%2520AM.png)

**More operators** 

== | equal to | compares values 
---|----------|----------------
===| strictly equals to | compares values and data type 
---|--------------------|------------------------------
!= | not equal to       |
---|--------------------|------------------------------
!==| strictly not equal to |


### **If statement**
to check a condition, if the condition equals true, any statement after the code block is applied

# **Extra notes**
1. a clear good commit massage is the best way to communicate a change to a fellow developer or your future self. 
2. IDE: "Integrated Development Enviroment", a software application that provides a comprehensive facilities to computer programmers, for software development.
