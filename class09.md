## **Forms**: 
* We can collect info from client by forms,by putting it inside form.
* Each info in form had a name and value.
* each form control is givin a name,and the text the user types in or the values of three options they select are sent to the server.
* Html have a new form that is easyer to be used

**How forms work**

- input selected by user, hits submit
- name of each form control and value sent to server
- backend processes it, may send to database
- server creates new page for user based on information received 
< form > action method id
< input > size type name maxlength
< textarea >

## **Lists** 
1. There are several elements that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
2. List-style-type and list-style image properties, can be used to change the list style.

3. Table cells can have different borders and spacing in X different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.
4. Forms are easier to use if the form controls are X vertically aligned using CSS.
Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more X interactive.

**Three ways to bind an event to an element:**

- HTML event handlers
- Traditional DOM event handlers
- DOM level 2 event listeners
- Traditional DOM event handlers:
- element.onevent = functionName;
