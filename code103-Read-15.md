# Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative 
diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation.

2. Diverse companies perform better
research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.
- researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

- researchers found that for banks focused on innovation, racial diversity was clearly tied to better financial performance.

3. Companies are losing out on great talent 
Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.

When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. 

5. It’s the right thing to do

# When Women Stopped Coding
A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women. And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged. 

### The beginning:
The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. This may be because computer games were mainly marketed to men and boys more, and even the movies' industry encouraged this idea with many movies produced at the time.
