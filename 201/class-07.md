# **Domain Modeling** 
to create a model in code to solve a specific problem. 
**object oriented model** is an entity that stores data in properties, and includes behaviors in methods.
1. one should start with constructing a function, to define properties between many objects.
2. then you can add content using the **new** keyword, **this** variable is used to initialize properties inside an object. 

## Generate random numbers: 
Math.random(), function allows to generate random number, you can set you max. and min. value to determine the range.

## **Tables**
In HTML a table is written out row by row.
* We start with <table> element, <tr> tag indicates the start of each row, then <td> tag which represnt cells, <th> represents headings; each has a closing tag.
* a scope attribute can be use with <th> tag to indicate wether it is a column or raw header. 
* colspan attribute can be use to strech (merge cells) a cell across more than one column. 
* rowspan attribute can be use to strech (merge cells) a cell across more than one column. 
* <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> are used to distinguish table parts from one another.

# **Chapter 3** 
## **Functions, Methods, and Objects** 

### **Creating an object: 
* we frist staret with new Object to create a blank object after that we start adding properties and methods inside it using dot notation. 
* updating or deleting content is done by dot notation or by using square brackets.

**Objects can be created by: 
1. LITERAL NOTATION 
2. OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION

**NOTE** 
Arrays are a type of object, since they key for each value is its index.

### **BUILT-IN OBJECTS**
1. BROWSER OBJECT MODEL
2. DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
3. GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS
