# REST 

REST is acronym for Representational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous dissertation.

### REST architecture
* client-server.
* stateless.
* cacheable.
* uniform interface.
* layered system.
* code on demand.

**API:**In basic terms, APIs are a set of functions and procedures that allow for the creation of applications that access data and features of other applications, services, or operating systems.

**HTTP** tells the browser what protocol to use. describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. 

***NOTE*** The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

* A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts, URLS. URLS tell the browser that there’s a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.

* Other types of representation: It doesn’t get used a lot, in most cases a resource has only a single representation.

* Concepts also known as “Web Services” or “APIs”. It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do. Computers can use same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.

### Why do I need an API key?

API keys identify an application’s traffic for the API producer, in case the application developer needs to work with the API producer to debug an issue or show their application’s usage. You want to control the number of calls made to your API. You want to identify usage patterns in your API’s traffic.
