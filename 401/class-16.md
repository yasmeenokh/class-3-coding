# Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).

2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers.

3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
putting it on a Web server so that it can be used either through the Internet.

# Vocabulary Terms

**Server:** is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers.

**Pub/Sub:** is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services that process events. it can be used as messaging-oriented middleware or event ingestion and delivery for streaming analytics pipelines.

**WRRC:** The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren’t working).

# Virtual Machine (VM)
Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

**Hypervisor** is a software that allows us to create VMs,  it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously, allowing for multiple environments which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine.

Virtualization can make 1 resource act like many, while cloud computing lets different departments (through private cloud) or companies (through a public cloud) access a single pool of automatically provisioned resources.

Virtual machine technology is used for many use cases across on-premises and cloud environments. More recently, public cloud services are using virtual machines to provide virtual application resources to multiple users at once, for even more cost efficient and flexible compute.

# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2):
is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.
