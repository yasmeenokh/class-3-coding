**Stack:**
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

**Basic Terminologies**:
1. we use **push** to add a node to the stack at the end of the stack.
2. we use **pop** to remove a node from the stack at the end of the stack.
3. we use **top** it means the top in node in the stack.
4. we use **peek** to view the value of the top node. 
5. we use **isEmpty** tells us if the stack is empty or the node is empty.

**It follow the concept of FILO : first in last out**

**Queue:**

**Basic Terminologies**:
1. we use **Enqueue** to add a node to the queue at the start of the stack.
2. we use **Dequeue** to remove a node from the queue at the start of the stack.
3. we use **Front** it means the top in node in the queue.
4. we use **Rear** it means the last node of the queue. 
5. we use **peek** to view the value of the front node.

6. we use **isEmpty** tells us if the stack is empty or the node is empty.

**It follow the concept of FIFO : first in first out**
