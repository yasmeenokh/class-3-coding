1. Make sure you fully understand the problem before coding, and keep it simple while you are doing coding. You can do so by following these steps:

    1. read the problem at least two times.
    2. solve the problem manually. 
    3. optimize the steps.
    4. write the manual steps as comments.
    5. replace the comments with the real code.
    6. optimize the code.

## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour 

- **Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness**

* What you think is what you become. If you think your time is worth a few bucks an hour, that you’ll begin to act like it. You’ll find yourself saying “yes” to meaningless, pointless obligations.
But if, in your heart, you know your time is valuable… People will recognize that. People will respect that. People will treat you differently.

## How to think like a programmer

- Problem solving is the meta-skill. 

**NOTE:**
1. The best way to master problem solving is by **Practicing**. Employers prioritize problem-solving skill first. 

2. Focus on learning how to solve problems and not on learning the syntax.

#### Have a framework: 

1. Understand: understand the problem first, try to write a diagram, or explain it to someone else. 

2. Plan: plan your solution first, write the exact steps, analyze and process the problem.

3. Divide: Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve. afterwards connect the dots.

4. When Stuck:
    - Debug => Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. 
    - Reassess => Look at the problem from another perspective.
    - Research => No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. 

    **NOTE:** Sometime it is a good idea to delete everything and begin with a fresh start.

5. Practice :  solve a lot of problems, 

## 5 Whys; Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

1. Assemble a Team: Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix.

2. Define the Problem: observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.

3. Ask the First "Why?" : Ask your team why the problem is occurring. Search for answers that are grounded in fact.

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times: Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

5. Know When to Stop: You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further.

## What the heck is the event loop anyway? 

**Call Stack:** is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function.

1. When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
2. Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
3. When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
4. If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

**Event Loop:** which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.

## The Super Mario Effect: 

the trick to learn more and finding more success is to frame the learning process in a way not to concern yourself with failure and, focus on learning and the goal, and not on how many times you failed, which will lead to more learning thus more success.Try to learn from each failure, and not endure the desire to give up.
