![base](https://oracle-patches.com/images/2019/11/09/flexbox-css_large.jpg)

## *What is Mustache?*
Mustache is a simple template system that you can use when building websites and web apps. By using a template system, you can keep your back-end code separate from the markup that displays the front end to the user. This clean separation gives you many advantages. For example, it makes it easy for a designer to work on a website’s visual design without the risk of messing up the site’s code. It also makes it easy for you to change the design at a later point without impacting the back-end code.

## Template-ing with Mustache

* JavaScript template-ing is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with JavaScript using a JSON data source.

* Template is HTML markup, with added template-ing tags that will insert variables run programming logic.

* Template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

* Moustache: a logic-less template syntax, works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object- Logic-less because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops, instead there are only tags. 

* mustache.js is implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. 

* Mustache is not a template-ing engine, but a specification for a template-ing language.

* If you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express.

### Some terminology
1. main axis : The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property. 

2. main size – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.

3. cross axis – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.

4. cross size – The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.
