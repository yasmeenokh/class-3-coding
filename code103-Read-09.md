# Functional Programming in JavaScript
we used to use Object-Oriented Programming in most of our real-world use-cases for better or for worse. Most use-cases of Functional Programming back then rely solely on mathematical computations whether simple or complex and the usage of it in components like buttons, textbox, checkbox never really fit in most of our scenarios.

### What is Functional Programming?
Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions. These functions take input which is called as arguments then shows the output based on the inputs being taken which, given the same input always results in the same output.

### Features of Functional Programming

- **First-Class entities Functions**
What’s good about Functional Programming is its functions are first-class entities: you can always insert functions inside a function without any restrictions present.

- **Higher-Order Functions**
A higher-order function is a function that gets a function as an argument. It may or may not return a function as its resulting output.

- **Function Composition**
Functional Programming won’t be completely functional without this feature. Function Composition is an act of composing/creating functions that allow you to further simplify and compress your functions by taking functions as an argument and return an output. It may also return another function as its output other than numerical/string values.

- **Immutability**
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

# Refactoring
Refactoring is rewriting code for performance and readability. Writing good code from the start is best practice, rather than having to rewrite code.

### When Should We Refactor Your Code?
A great time to refactor your code is when you are working with something that you need to write over and over again. This isn’t the only time that you can refactor your code, however, it’s extremely common to run into things that are repetitive.
