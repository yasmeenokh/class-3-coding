# **Functions** 

* functions allow you to group a series of statements togather to perform a specific task.
* A statement in a function is not always executed when a page loads. 
* Some functions nedd to be provided with information to perform a task, these picese ot information are known as parameters. 
* programming language often relay upon name/value pairs 

## **Function declaration** 
To creat a function you give it a name, then write the statements you want to achieve inside curly braces. you excute a function by calling it, which is basicly typing the function name. 
**NOTE** 
1. If a function needs a specific information we add a parameter, which acts as a variable.
2. Some functions return information when they are called, by using a **return** statement.
